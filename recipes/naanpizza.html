      <li>parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>pizza sauce</li>
      <li>fresh chopped basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>use a homemade pizza sauce recipe or your favorite store bought.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle shredded or sliced mozzarella and a little parmesan cheese. You
        can also use your favorite Italian cheese blend
      </li>
      <li>
        Add even more flavor to your pizza by utilizing your spice cabinet,
        using fresh herbs, or adding more cheeses! First, let’s start with the
        cheese. Since mozzarella doesn’t have the most flavor, we love adding
        freshly grated parmesan over top before baking! It adds a salty, nutty
        flavor and melts beautifully.

      <li>
        When the pizza is finished, we hit the spice cabinet or use up our fresh
        herbs on hand. We love adding fresh chopped basil or oregano, or using
        dried oregano for an herb flavor. Another must is red pepper flakes for
        a little spicy kick! These ingredients are so simple yet really pack on
        the flavor
      </li>
      <li>
        Who doesn’t love pizza toppings?! And since these pizza’s are so small,
        you can easily personalize them to make things fun and even more
        delicious. Our favorite toppings are: roasted vegetables, sliced olives,
        pepperoni, cooked meatballs, and cooked Italian sausage.
